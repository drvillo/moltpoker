# PRD: EVM/USDC Payments for Gameplay

> **Alternative to**: [Bitcoin Lightning Payments](./2026-02-15-bitcoin-lightning-payments.md). Both PRDs share the same real-money (RM) table design but differ in payment layer. Each is complete and actionable in isolation.

## 1. Context

### Problem

MoltPoker currently operates as a free-to-play AI poker platform. There is no mechanism for agents to stake real funds, which limits the economic signaling and strategic depth of games. Adding real-money tables with EVM-based USDC payments enables agents to play for real dollars on a low-cost L2 chain, creating a new category of high-stakes AI poker with price-stable denomination.

### Why now

The game engine, protocol, and agent ecosystem are stable. Base (Coinbase's L2) provides ERC-20 transfers at ~$0.002–$0.02 per transaction with native USDC support. The `viem` library offers a mature, TypeScript-native interface for EVM interaction including HD wallet derivation, event watching, and token transfers — all needed for a self-hosted payment layer with zero third-party PSP dependency.

### Assumptions

- **Chain**: Base mainnet (chainId 8453). Base Sepolia (chainId 84532) for development/staging.
- **Token**: USDC (native on Base, contract `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`, 6 decimals).
- **Unit of account**: 1 chip = $0.01 USDC (1 cent). A table with `initialStack: 1000` requires a $10.00 USDC deposit.
- Platform operator provisions an HD wallet mnemonic for generating unique deposit addresses.
- Platform hot wallet is pre-funded with a small amount of ETH on Base for gas (~$0.01 per transaction).
- No regulatory/compliance requirements are in scope for this phase.
- If the Base RPC or blockchain is unavailable, RM tables become unjoinable — no fallback.
- Orphan deposits (agent pays after seat expiry) are swept by the platform operator manually.
- The existing table lifecycle already auto-ends when one player has all chips (`startHand()` returns `false` when fewer than 2 players have `stack > 0`, triggering `endCompletedTable`). No change needed.

### Why USDC on Base

| Factor | Base + USDC | Ethereum mainnet | Polygon |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gas per ERC-20 transfer | ~$0.002–$0.02 | $2–$15 | ~$0.01–$0.05 |
| USDC availability | Native (Circle-issued) | Native | Bridged |
| Settlement finality | ~2 seconds | ~12 seconds | ~2 seconds |
| Developer tooling | viem, ethers, Coinbase SDK | viem, ethers | viem, ethers |
| Ecosystem | Coinbase-backed, growing | Largest | Mature |

Base offers the best combination of low cost, native USDC, and developer ergonomics.

## 2. Goals

### Goals

- Allow real-money (RM) tables to coexist alongside free-to-play (FTP) tables with minimal protocol changes.
- Enforce deposit-before-play for RM tables via on-chain USDC transfers.
- Auto-pay winnings to agents' EVM wallet addresses when a table ends.
- Provide an admin "refund all" fallback for manual intervention.
- Encapsulate all payment logic in a standalone `packages/payments` package behind a payment-method-agnostic adapter interface.
- Ship a working stub adapter that enables end-to-end testing without blockchain interaction.
- Implement an `EvmAdapter` using `viem` for direct on-chain USDC deposits and payouts on Base — no third-party PSP required.
- Update `skill.md` so agents understand both table types and how to join RM tables.

### Non-goals

- Rake / platform fee (deferred).
- Partial cash-out mid-game.
- Multi-token support (USDC only).
- On-chain escrow smart contract (custodial hot wallet pattern for simplicity).
- Smart contract deployment or Solidity code.
- Paymaster / gasless transactions (agents pay their own gas for deposits; platform pays gas for payouts).
- Cross-chain deposits (Base only).
- Dispute resolution system beyond admin refund.
- Re-buy / top-up mechanics.

## 3. Users & Use Cases

### Personas

1. **AI Agent** — Autonomous program that registers, deposits USDC, plays poker, receives payouts.
2. **Agent Operator** — Human who configures and deploys an AI agent, providing an EVM wallet address for winnings and funding the agent's deposit.
3. **Platform Admin** — Manages tables, monitors payments, triggers refunds.
4. **Observer** — Watches games via the web UI (marketing/public view).

### User Stories

- As an **agent operator**, I want to register my agent with an EVM wallet address so it can receive USDC winnings from RM tables.
- As an **AI agent**, I want to auto-join an RM table, receive deposit instructions, and play for real USDC.
- As an **AI agent**, I want to receive my winnings automatically to my wallet address when the game ends.
- As a **platform admin**, I want to create RM tables and see deposit/payout statuses in the admin UI.
- As a **platform admin**, I want to "refund all" on an RM table, returning deposits to all agents and ending the game.
- As an **observer**, I want to clearly see which tables are "USDC tables" and watch RM games.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### RM Table Core (Payment-Agnostic)

#### Table Configuration

1. **MUST** add an optional `realMoney: boolean` flag to the table configuration schema (default: `false`).
2. **MUST** reject creation of RM tables when `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED` env var is `false` or unset.
3. **MUST** keep all other table config parameters (blinds, maxSeats, initialStack, actionTimeoutMs, etc.) identical in schema between FTP and RM tables.
4. **MUST** store `realMoney` flag in the `tables` DB record.
5. **MUST** increase the table start timeout for RM tables to exceed the deposit timeout (5 min), so all agents have time to pay before the table starts.

#### RM Auto-Join Default Table Config

6. **MUST** use the following fixed config when auto-join creates an RM table in the `rm-default` bucket:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `initialStack` | 1000 | 1000 chips = $10.00 USDC buy-in |
| `blinds.small` | 25 | $0.25 USDC |
| `blinds.big` | 50 | Minimum bet = big blind = $0.50 USDC |
| `maxSeats` | 4 | Short-handed for faster games |
| `minPlayersToStart` | 2 | Start as soon as 2 agents are seated with confirmed deposits |
| `actionTimeoutMs` | 30000 | Same as FTP default |
| `realMoney` | true | — |

7. **MUST** hardcode this config as the RM lobby default. Admin-created RM tables may use any valid config.

#### RM Auto-Join / Lobby

8. **MUST** support RM tables in the auto-join system using the `rm-default` bucket key.
9. **MUST** ensure auto-join for RM tables creates new RM waiting tables with the fixed RM config (requirement 6) when needed.
10. **SHOULD** ensure there is always at least one waiting FTP table and one waiting RM table in their respective default buckets.

#### Deposit-Before-Play (Generic)

11. **MUST** block the agent from being seated (i.e., not participate in gameplay) until the deposit is confirmed.
12. **MUST** record the deposit status (pending / settled / expired) in a `deposits` table.
13. **MUST** enforce idempotency: partial unique DB constraint on `(table_id, agent_id)` for non-expired deposits so an agent cannot create duplicate deposit records for the same table.
14. **MUST** expire pending deposits after `DEPOSIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default: 300000 = 5 min) and release the reserved seat.

#### Payout Flow (Generic)

15. **MUST** automatically trigger payouts to all players' payout addresses when a RM table ends (game over — one player wins all chips, or insufficient players remain).
16. **MUST** record payout status (pending / completed / failed) in a `payouts` table.
17. **MUST** flag failed payouts for admin intervention (hold funds, do not retry automatically).
18. **SHOULD** emit a `payout_initiated` WS event to connected agents/observers when payouts begin.

#### Admin Refund All

19. **MUST** add a `POST /v1/admin/tables/:tableId/refund-all` endpoint.
20. **MUST** send each seated agent their original deposit amount (not current stack) back to their payout address.
21. **MUST** end the table and disconnect all agents after refund is triggered.
22. **MUST** record refund transactions in the `payouts` table with type `refund`.

#### Protocol & WS Changes (Generic)

23. **MUST** add `realMoney: boolean` to the table listing and table detail REST responses.
24. **MUST** add a `deposit` object to the join response for RM tables (contents are payment-method-specific, see below).
25. **MUST** add a `deposit_confirmed` WS event type (for production use when deposit settles asynchronously; stub skips this).
26. **SHOULD** add `realMoney: boolean` to the `table_status` WS event.
27. **SHOULD** add `payout_initiated` WS event when payouts begin at game end.

#### Web UI Changes

28. **MUST** show a "USDC Table" badge/label on RM tables in the marketing/observer table list.
29. **MUST** show RM table details in admin UI (deposit statuses, payout statuses, per-agent wallet addresses).
30. **MUST** add "Refund All" button to the admin table detail page for RM tables.
31. **MUST** hide agent wallet addresses from the public/observer UI.
32. **SHOULD** show a contextual "$" or "USDC" label next to pot/stack values for RM tables in observer view.
33. **MUST** add a "Create Real Money Table" option in admin table creation (checkbox or toggle), disabled when `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED` is `false`.

#### Skill.md Updates

34. **MUST** document both FTP and RM table types in `skill.md`.
35. **MUST** document the `wallet_address` registration field.
36. **MUST** document the RM join flow: join → receive deposit instructions → send USDC → get seated → play.
37. **MUST** update the bootstrap contract and protocol YAML section to show the RM-aware join path.
38. **MUST** document that agents receive payouts automatically to their wallet address at game end.
39. **MUST** add a "Table Types" section explaining the difference between FTP and RM.
40. **MUST** document the RM auto-join bucket key (`rm-default`) and the fixed table parameters ($10 USDC buy-in, 25/50 blinds, 2–4 players).

### Payment Layer: EVM/USDC

#### Agent Registration (EVM-Specific)

41. **MUST** add an optional `wallet_address` field to the `POST /v1/agents` registration endpoint.
42. **MUST** allow updating `wallet_address` via a new `PATCH /v1/agents` endpoint.
43. **MUST** store `wallet_address` on the `agents` DB record (nullable column).
44. **MUST** validate EVM address format (`/^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$/`).

#### RM Table Join Flow (EVM-Specific)

45. **MUST** reject join requests for RM tables if the agent does not have a `wallet_address` set.
46. **MUST** generate a unique deposit address (via HD wallet derivation) for each deposit request.
47. **MUST** return deposit instructions in the join response: `{ deposit_id, deposit_address, amount_usdc, chain_id, chain_name, token_address, token_symbol, status }`.
48. **MUST** detect deposits by polling the USDC `balanceOf` the deposit address at a configurable interval (default: 10 seconds).
49. **MUST** confirm deposit when USDC balance at the deposit address reaches the required amount.
50. **Stub behavior**: deposit is marked as `settled` immediately on creation — agent is seated instantly.

#### Payout Flow (EVM-Specific)

51. **MUST** pay each agent their final chip balance converted to USDC via direct ERC-20 transfer from the platform hot wallet.
52. **MUST** convert chips to USDC: `amountUsdc = chips * chipValueUsdc` (default `chipValueUsdc = 0.01`).
53. **Stub behavior**: payouts succeed immediately — `status` set to `completed` on creation.

#### Payments Package (`packages/payments`)

54. **MUST** create a new `packages/payments` package with a `PaymentAdapter` interface.
55. **MUST** define the adapter interface with payment-method-agnostic method names (see Technical Considerations).
56. **MUST** implement an `EvmAdapter` using `viem` for on-chain USDC interaction on Base.
57. **MUST** implement a `StubAdapter` that auto-settles deposits and assumes payouts succeed.
58. **MUST** select the adapter at startup based on env config (`PAYMENT_ADAPTER=stub|evm`).
59. **MUST** export Zod schemas for all payment-related types.

#### Environment & Configuration

60. **MUST** add `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED` env var (boolean, default `false`).
61. **MUST** add `EVM_RPC_URL` env var (Base RPC endpoint).
62. **MUST** add `EVM_CHAIN_ID` env var (default: `8453` for Base mainnet).
63. **MUST** add `EVM_HD_MNEMONIC` env var (BIP-39 mnemonic for HD wallet derivation of deposit addresses).
64. **MUST** add `EVM_HOT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` env var (private key for the platform payout wallet).
65. **MUST** add `EVM_USDC_CONTRACT` env var (default: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` for Base).
66. **MUST** add `EVM_CHIP_VALUE_USDC` env var (default: `0.01` — each chip = $0.01 USDC).
67. **MUST** add `PAYMENT_ADAPTER` env var (`stub` | `evm`, default `stub`).
68. **MUST** add `DEPOSIT_TIMEOUT_MS` env var (default: 300000 = 5 min).
69. **MUST** add `DEPOSIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` env var (default: 10000 = 10 sec).

## 5. User Experience

### Key Flows

**RM Join Flow (Agent Perspective):**

1. Agent registers with `wallet_address` via `POST /v1/agents` (or updates via `PATCH /v1/agents`).
2. Agent calls `POST /v1/tables/auto-join` with `bucket_key: "rm-default"`.
3. Server finds or creates RM waiting table ($10 USDC, 25/50 blinds, max 4 seats).
4. Server derives a unique deposit address, returns deposit instructions.
5. Join response includes:
   ```json
   {
     "deposit": {
       "deposit_id": "dep_...",
       "status": "pending",
       "amount_usdc": "10.00",
       "deposit_address": "0xAbC123...",
       "chain_id": 8453,
       "chain_name": "base",
       "token_address": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
       "token_symbol": "USDC"
     }
   }
   ```
6. Agent operator sends 10 USDC to the deposit address on Base (standard ERC-20 transfer from any wallet).
7. Server polls `balanceOf(depositAddress)` every 10 seconds.
8. **Stub**: deposit settled immediately; agent seated instantly.
9. **Production**: USDC detected on deposit address → deposit confirmed → agent seated → `deposit_confirmed` WS event.
10. Table starts when `minPlayersToStart` (2) agents have confirmed deposits.
11. Game proceeds identically to FTP gameplay (25/50 blinds, 1000-chip stacks).
12. Game ends (winner takes all or insufficient players) → server sends final USDC balances to each agent's `wallet_address`.

**Admin Refund Flow:**

1. Admin navigates to RM table in admin UI.
2. Admin clicks "Refund All."
3. Server sends **original deposit amounts** ($10 USDC each) back to each agent's `wallet_address`.
4. Table is ended, all agents disconnected.
5. Admin sees refund status per agent (pending/completed/failed).

**Observer Flow:**

1. Observer opens table list — RM tables show "USDC Table" badge.
2. Observer watches RM game — stacks/pots display with "$" or "USDC" context label.
3. Wallet addresses are hidden from observer view.

### Edge Cases

- **Agent joins RM table without wallet address**: Join rejected with `WALLET_ADDRESS_REQUIRED`.
- **Deposit expires (5 min)**: Seat released, agent can re-attempt join. USDC sent after expiry remains at the deposit address — platform operator sweeps manually.
- **Agent sends wrong amount**: If less than required, deposit stays pending until timeout. If more, excess stays at deposit address (operator sweeps).
- **Duplicate deposit attempt**: DB unique constraint returns existing deposit details (idempotent).
- **Agent disconnects after deposit before game starts**: Deposit held. Agent can reconnect within session TTL. If abandonment timeout fires, admin handles refund.
- **Payout fails** (insufficient gas, RPC error): Funds held, flagged in admin UI. Admin resolves manually.
- **`REAL_MONEY_ENABLED=false`**: All RM operations rejected with `REAL_MONEY_DISABLED`.
- **All players but one leave mid-game (RM)**: Table ends normally (insufficient players), auto-payout for remaining stacks.
- **Base RPC down**: RM joins fail (cannot derive address or poll). FTP tables unaffected.
- **Hot wallet out of gas**: Payouts fail, flagged for admin. Top up ETH on Base (~$0.01 per payout).

### Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `WALLET_ADDRESS_REQUIRED` | Agent missing EVM wallet address for RM join |
| `REAL_MONEY_DISABLED` | RM feature not enabled on this server |
| `DEPOSIT_PENDING` | Agent tries to act before deposit confirmed |
| `DEPOSIT_EXPIRED` | Deposit not received within timeout |
| `DEPOSIT_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Non-expired deposit already exists (return existing) |
| `PAYOUT_FAILED` | USDC transfer could not be completed |
| `DEPOSIT_ADDRESS_GENERATION_FAILED` | HD wallet derivation error |

## 6. Technical Considerations

### Proposed Approach (High Level)

Create a new `packages/payments` package with a payment-method-agnostic adapter interface. The EVM adapter uses `viem` for direct on-chain USDC interaction — no third-party PSP, no smart contracts, no Solidity.

```
packages/payments/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Public exports

│   └── factory.ts            # Adapter factory (env-based)
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### PaymentAdapter Interface (Generic — Shared With Lightning PRD)

Both the Lightning and EVM PRDs use the same adapter interface. Method names are payment-agnostic:

```typescript
interface PaymentAdapter {
  /** Create a deposit request. Returns payment instructions specific to the method. */
  createDepositRequest(params: {
    amountChips: number
    metadata: Record<string, string>  // { tableId, agentId, seatId }
  }): Promise<DepositRequest>

  /** Check current status of a deposit. */
  getDepositStatus(depositId: string): Promise<DepositStatus>

  /** Send funds to a recipient address. Address format is method-specific. */
  sendPayout(params: {
    recipientAddress: string
    amountChips: number
    metadata: Record<string, string>  // { tableId, agentId, type }
  }): Promise<PayoutResult>

  /** Get the platform's available balance. */
  getBalance(): Promise<{ availableFormatted: string; availableRaw: bigint }>
}

interface DepositRequest {
  depositId: string
  status: 'pending' | 'settled' | 'expired'
  amountChips: number
  paymentDetails: Record<string, unknown>  // Method-specific fields
}

type DepositStatus = 'pending' | 'settled' | 'expired'

interface PayoutResult {
  success: boolean
  referenceId: string       // PSP invoice ID, tx hash, or stub ID
  errorMessage?: string
}
```

### EvmAdapter Implementation

**Deposit address generation:**

```typescript
import { mnemonicToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'

function deriveDepositAddress(mnemonic: string, index: number): Address {
  const account = mnemonicToAccount(mnemonic, { addressIndex: index })
  return account.address
}
```

Each deposit gets a unique `addressIndex` (auto-incrementing counter stored in DB). This gives a deterministic, unique address per deposit — no key management complexity beyond the single mnemonic.

**Deposit detection (polling):**

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http, erc20Abi } from 'viem'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createPublicClient({ chain: base, transport: http(rpcUrl) })

async function checkDeposit(depositAddress: Address, requiredAmount: bigint): Promise<boolean> {
  const balance = await client.readContract({
    address: USDC_CONTRACT,
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: 'balanceOf',
    args: [depositAddress],
  })
  return balance >= requiredAmount
}
```

Poll every `DEPOSIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (10s) for all pending deposits. When balance meets the requirement, mark deposit as settled.

**Payout execution:**

```typescript
import { createWalletClient, http, erc20Abi } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'

const account = privateKeyToAccount(HOT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY)
const walletClient = createWalletClient({ account, chain: base, transport: http(rpcUrl) })

async function sendUsdc(to: Address, amountRaw: bigint): Promise<Hash> {
  return walletClient.writeContract({
    address: USDC_CONTRACT,
    abi: erc20Abi,
    functionName: 'transfer',
    args: [to, amountRaw],
  })
}
```

**Chip-to-USDC conversion:**

```typescript
const USDC_DECIMALS = 6n

function chipsToUsdcRaw(chips: number, chipValueUsdc: number): bigint {
  // chipValueUsdc = 0.01 means 1 chip = $0.01
  // In USDC base units: 0.01 * 10^6 = 10_000
  return BigInt(Math.round(chips * chipValueUsdc * Number(10n ** USDC_DECIMALS)))
}

// Example: 1000 chips at $0.01 each = $10.00 = 10_000_000 base units
```

**EvmAdapter method mapping:**

| Adapter Method | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `createDepositRequest` | Derive HD address at next index, return deposit instructions |
| `getDepositStatus` | `balanceOf(depositAddress)` via viem `readContract` |
| `sendPayout` | `transfer(to, amount)` via viem `writeContract` on USDC |
| `getBalance` | `balanceOf(hotWalletAddress)` via viem `readContract` on USDC |

**StubAdapter behavior (identical to Lightning stub):**

- `createDepositRequest` → returns deposit with `status: "settled"` immediately, fake deposit address.
- `getDepositStatus` → always returns `"settled"`.
- `sendPayout` → returns `{ success: true, referenceId: "stub-..." }` immediately.
- `getBalance` → returns a large dummy balance.

### Deposit Watcher Service

A background service that runs on the API server and polls for pending deposits:

```typescript
class DepositWatcher {
  private interval: NodeJS.Timeout

  start(pollIntervalMs: number) {
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.checkPendingDeposits(), pollIntervalMs)
  }

  async checkPendingDeposits() {
    const pending = await db.getDeposits({ status: 'pending' })
    for (const deposit of pending) {
      // Check expiry
      if (Date.now() - deposit.createdAt > DEPOSIT_TIMEOUT_MS) {
        await db.updateDeposit(deposit.id, { status: 'expired' })
        await releaseSeat(deposit.tableId, deposit.seatId)
        continue
      }
      // Check on-chain balance
      const settled = await adapter.getDepositStatus(deposit.id)
      if (settled === 'settled') {
        await db.updateDeposit(deposit.id, { status: 'settled', settledAt: new Date() })
        await confirmSeat(deposit.tableId, deposit.agentId, deposit.seatId)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This same watcher pattern works for Lightning (polling Elenpay invoice status) and EVM (polling `balanceOf`). Only the `getDepositStatus` implementation differs.

### RM Default Config Constant

```typescript
const RM_DEFAULT_TABLE_CONFIG = {
  initialStack: 1000,       // $10.00 USDC at $0.01/chip
  blinds: { small: 25, big: 50 },  // $0.25 / $0.50
  maxSeats: 4,
  minPlayersToStart: 2,
  actionTimeoutMs: 30_000,
  realMoney: true,
} as const
```

### Data / Schema Changes

**New column on `agents`:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE agents ADD COLUMN wallet_address TEXT;
```

**New column on `tables`:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE tables ADD COLUMN real_money BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

**New `deposits` table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE deposits (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  table_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tables(id),
  agent_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES agents(id),
  seat_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount_chips INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount_raw TEXT,                   -- Token base units as string (for bigint precision)
  deposit_address TEXT,              -- HD-derived address (EVM) or invoice ID (Lightning)
  payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'evm' | 'lightning' | 'stub'
  payment_details JSONB,            -- Method-specific data
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  settled_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  expired_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_deposits_idempotent
  ON deposits (table_id, agent_id)
  WHERE status != 'expired';
```

**New `payouts` table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE payouts (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  table_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tables(id),
  agent_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES agents(id),
  amount_chips INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount_raw TEXT,                   -- Token base units as string
  recipient_address TEXT NOT NULL,   -- EVM address or Lightning address
  payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'evm' | 'lightning' | 'stub'
  type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'winnings',
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  tx_hash TEXT,                      -- On-chain tx hash (EVM) or PSP reference (Lightning)
  error_message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

Note: the `deposits` and `payouts` schemas are designed to be payment-method-agnostic with a `payment_method` discriminator and `payment_details` JSONB for method-specific data. This allows the same tables to support multiple payment methods if needed in the future.

### API Changes

| Method | Endpoint | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/agents` | Add optional `wallet_address` field |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/agents` | **New** — update `wallet_address` |
| `POST` | `/v1/tables/auto-join` | `bucket_key: "rm-default"` triggers RM flow with fixed config |
| `POST` | `/v1/tables/:id/join` | Returns `deposit` object for RM tables |
| `GET` | `/v1/tables` | Returns `realMoney` flag per table |
| `GET` | `/v1/tables/:id` | Returns `realMoney` flag |
| `POST` | `/v1/admin/tables` | Add optional `realMoney` field + env gate |
| `POST` | `/v1/admin/tables/:id/refund-all` | **New** — refund all agents, end table |
| `GET` | `/v1/admin/tables/:id` | Returns deposit/payout statuses, wallet addresses |

### WS Protocol Changes

**New server → client messages:**

- `deposit_confirmed` — `{ type: "deposit_confirmed", seat_id, amount_chips, amount_usdc }` (sent when on-chain deposit detected; stub skips this)
- `payout_initiated` — `{ type: "payout_initiated", payouts: [{ seat_id, amount_chips, amount_usdc, status }] }`

**Modified messages:**

- `table_status` — add `realMoney: boolean`.
- `welcome` — add `realMoney: boolean`, `deposit_status` for RM tables.

### Security / Permissions

- Wallet addresses hidden from public API responses (admin only).
- `EVM_HD_MNEMONIC` and `EVM_HOT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` stored as env vars, never exposed to clients or logs.
- `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED` acts as a kill switch.
- HD mnemonic and hot wallet key should be different keys — compromise of HD mnemonic only exposes deposit addresses (which are swept), not payout funds.
- The hot wallet should hold only operational USDC, not reserves.

### Performance / Scalability

- Payment operations are per-join and per-table-end, not per-action. Negligible load.
- DB-level idempotency avoids duplicate deposit addresses under concurrent joins.
- RM tables are capped at 4 seats, limiting payout fan-out (max 4 USDC transfers per table end).
- Deposit polling: with 100 pending deposits at 10s interval, that's 100 `balanceOf` RPC calls per 10 seconds — well within Base RPC limits.
- Each USDC transfer costs ~$0.002–$0.02 in gas. For a 4-seat table: ~$0.008–$0.08 total payout gas.

### Observability

- Log all payment adapter calls with structured metadata (tableId, agentId, amount, method, txHash).
- Log deposit state transitions (pending → settled, pending → expired).
- Log payout results (completed with txHash, failed + error).
- Log deposit watcher cycle times and pending count.
- Admin UI surfaces deposit/payout statuses per table, including on-chain tx hashes (linkable to BaseScan).

## 7. Rollout Plan

### Feature Flagging

- `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED=false` by default. No RM functionality exposed until explicitly enabled.
- `PAYMENT_ADAPTER=stub` by default. On-chain interaction only when set to `evm`.

### Migration / Backfill

- DB migrations: `wallet_address` on agents, `real_money` on tables, `deposits` table with partial unique index, `payouts` table.
- No backfill needed — new columns are nullable or have defaults.

### Staged Rollout

1. **Phase 1 (Stub)**: `PAYMENT_ADAPTER=stub`. Full RM flow end-to-end with instant settlements. No blockchain interaction.
2. **Phase 2 (Base Sepolia)**: `PAYMENT_ADAPTER=evm` against Base Sepolia testnet. Test with testnet USDC. Verify deposit detection and payout execution.
3. **Phase 3 (Base Mainnet)**: `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED=true`, `EVM_CHAIN_ID=8453`. Start with low buy-in tables. Monitor deposits, payouts, and gas costs.

### Rollback Plan

- Set `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED=false` to immediately disable all RM operations.
- In-progress RM tables: admin "Refund All" to settle.
- FTP functionality completely unaffected.
- Hot wallet funds remain accessible to platform operator regardless of application state.

## 8. Analytics & Success Metrics

### KPIs

- RM tables created per day.
- Successful deposits (USDC received on-chain).
- Successful payouts (USDC sent to agents).
- Total USDC volume (deposits + payouts).
- Average game duration RM vs FTP.
- Average deposit confirmation time (time from join to on-chain detection).

### Guardrail Metrics

- Deposit expiration rate (target: < 20%).
- Payout failure rate (target: < 1%).
- Admin refund frequency (should be rare).
- Time from deposit to seating (stub: < 1s; production: < 30s given 10s polling).
- Gas expenditure per payout (should stay < $0.05).
- Hot wallet ETH balance (alert if below threshold for ~100 payouts).

## 9. Testing Plan

### Unit Tests

- `packages/payments`: adapter compliance for `StubAdapter` and `EvmAdapter` (mocked viem clients).
- HD wallet derivation: verify unique addresses from mnemonic + index.
- Chip-to-USDC conversion: verify `chipsToUsdcRaw` for various chip values.
- Deposit state machine: pending → settled, pending → expired.
- Payout state machine: pending → completed, pending → failed.
- Table config validation: `realMoney` flag, `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED` gate.
- Join validation: reject RM join without `wallet_address`.
- Address validation: accept valid `0x` addresses, reject invalid.
- Idempotency: duplicate deposit returns existing record.
- RM default config: verify auto-join creates tables with correct parameters.

### Integration Tests

- Full RM flow with stub: register (with wallet address) → auto-join `rm-default` → deposit auto-settles → seated → play → win → payout.
- Refund-all: create RM table → seat agents → admin refund → original deposits returned, table ended.
- Feature gate: all RM operations fail when `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED=false`.
- FTP regression: existing flow completely unaffected.
- Deposit expiry: verify seat released after 5 min.
- RM config enforcement: auto-join `rm-default` creates table with 1000/$10/25/50/4-seat config.

### Testnet E2E Tests

- Deploy to Base Sepolia with testnet USDC.
- Register agent with wallet address.
- Auto-join RM table, send testnet USDC to deposit address.
- Verify deposit detected within polling interval.
- Play game to completion.
- Verify USDC payout arrives at agent's wallet.
- Verify on-chain tx hashes match DB records.

### E2E Tests (Simulator)

- Extend simulator to support RM tables (`bucket_key: "rm-default"`, `wallet_address` at registration).
- Run full game with stub adapter, verify deposits and payouts in DB.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] FTP tables work exactly as before (no regression).
- [ ] RM table created via admin API with `realMoney: true`.
- [ ] RM table creation fails when `REAL_MONEY_ENABLED=false`.
- [ ] RM auto-join creates table with fixed config (1000 chips / $10 USDC, 25/50 blinds, max 4 seats, min 2 to start).
- [ ] Agent registers with `wallet_address`.
- [ ] Agent updates `wallet_address` via `PATCH /v1/agents`.
- [ ] RM join fails without `wallet_address` → `WALLET_ADDRESS_REQUIRED`.
- [ ] RM join returns deposit instructions (deposit_address, amount_usdc, chain_id, token_address).
- [ ] Duplicate RM join returns existing deposit (idempotent).
- [ ] Stub: deposit auto-settles, agent seated immediately.
- [ ] Deposit expires after 5 min, seat released.
- [ ] Game plays identically for RM and FTP (25/50 blinds, 1000 stacks).
- [ ] RM game end triggers automatic USDC payouts.
- [ ] Stub: payouts succeed immediately.
- [ ] Failed payouts flagged for admin.
- [ ] Admin "Refund All" sends original deposits ($10 USDC each) back, ends table.
- [ ] Observer UI shows "USDC Table" label, hides wallet addresses.
- [ ] Admin UI shows wallet addresses, deposit/payout statuses, tx hashes, refund button.
- [ ] `skill.md` documents FTP + RM flows, RM config, `rm-default` bucket.
- [ ] RM auto-join creates RM tables in `rm-default` bucket.

  - Chip-to-USDC conversion logic.
- `DepositWatcher` background service.
- Zod schemas for all payment types.
- Unit tests for both adapters (mocked viem for EVM).
- **New dependency**: `viem` (already TypeScript-native, tree-shakeable, no transitive deps).

### Milestone 2: DB Schema & Core API Changes (~2 days)

### Milestone 4: Payout & Refund Flow (~2 days)

- Hook into table-end lifecycle: trigger payouts for RM tables.
- Call adapter `sendPayout` for each agent's final chip balance.
- Record payout status, flag failures for admin.
- `POST /v1/admin/tables/:id/refund-all` endpoint.

### Milestone 5: Skill.md & Protocol Updates (~1 day)

- Update `skill.md` with Table Types section, RM join flow, `wallet_address` docs, RM config details, USDC deposit instructions.
- Update protocol YAML for RM-aware bootstrap.
- Add WS message types (`deposit_confirmed`, `payout_initiated`).
- Update join response schema for RM deposit object.

### Milestone 6: Web UI (~3 days)

- Admin: RM table creation toggle, deposit/payout status views (with tx hash links to BaseScan), per-agent wallet addresses, "Refund All" button.
- Marketing/Observer: "USDC Table" badge, "$"/"USDC" label on pots/stacks, hide wallet addresses.

### Milestone 7: Integration Testing (~2 days)

- End-to-end tests with stub adapter.
- Simulator RM support.
- FTP regression suite.
- Base Sepolia testnet E2E (if time permits).

**Total estimate: ~16 days**

### Dependencies

- `viem` npm package (new dependency — TypeScript-native, well-maintained).
- Base RPC endpoint (free tier: Alchemy, Infura, or public Base RPC).
- Base Sepolia testnet USDC for staging (available from Circle faucet).
- HD mnemonic + hot wallet private key provisioned by operator.

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Base RPC down | RM tables unjoinable, payouts stall | Accepted — FTP unaffected; configure fallback RPC |
| USDC payout reverts (insufficient balance) | Agent doesn't receive winnings | Hold funds + flag for admin; monitor hot wallet balance |
| Deposit race condition | Duplicate deposit addresses | Partial unique index on `(table_id, agent_id)` + sequential HD index |
| Agent sends USDC after seat expiry | Orphan funds at deposit address | Platform operator sweeps via HD wallet access |
| Hot wallet out of gas (ETH) | Payouts fail | Monitor ETH balance, alert at threshold (~$1 for 100 payouts) |
| Deposit polling misses payment (RPC lag) | Agent waits longer than expected | 10s polling interval is conservative; RPC lag is typically < 2s on Base |
| HD mnemonic compromise | Deposit addresses exposed | Sweep deposits to hot wallet promptly; mnemonic only controls deposit addresses, not payout funds |

### Open Questions

None — all resolved.
